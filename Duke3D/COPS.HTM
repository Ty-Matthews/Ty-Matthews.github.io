Make one large sector that will be our outside area.

Place 9 <b>Locator</b> Sprites within our large sector.  Place for now a
single Recon Monster Sprite (tile #1960) in the mix as well.  Arrange the
Locators in a circle and change their <b>lotags</b> in numerical sequence starting
from 0 (which won't require a change) up to 8, making sure not to skip any
digit.  The Recon cars will cross each Locator in sequence.  This is very similar
to Subways.  Recon cars cannot, however, stop at any given point.  They stop
on their own during the game.  Take and move the Locators out to the edges of
your sector in an oval pattern.

The Recon car <b>hitag</b> should be set to the first <b>locator lotag</b> that
it will cross.  In this case, our Recon car is right next to the first locator,
or locator #0, thus requiring no change to the tags.  You can have as many
Recon cars as you like in the game; just note that sometimes two cars will
stop to shoot at you and may then occupy the same space, following each other
around.  Switch to 3d mode and move our Recon car up in the air.  Clicking
and holding the left mouse button on the sprite <i>really</i> helps here.
Move all of the Locator sprites to the air as well, mixing up the altitude
to give the cars some up and down motion.
