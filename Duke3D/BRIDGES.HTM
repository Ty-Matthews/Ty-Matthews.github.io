<h1>Bridges</h1>

Start out making three sectors, like the image.  The top peninsula sector
will become the actual bridge.  The little island sector is just a place
to put our switch so we can watch the bridge move.

Insert a Sector Effector, Activator, and GPSpeed sprite within the
peninsula sector.  Change the <b>sector lotag</b> of the peninsula sector
to <b>27</b>.  Change to 3d mode and raise the floor of the peninsula sector up
2 or 3 clicks to make it stand out.  Raise the little island sector up 12 or
13 clicks so you can place a switch at Duke's level.  Insert a
sprite flat against one wall of the island sector, and change its tile to
some switch tile (I'll use Dipswitch, tile #162.)  Change the <b>switch's
lotag</b> to a unique switch number (I'll use 1 in this example.)  Give that
same number to the <b>Activator Lotag</b> and <b>Sector Effector hitag</b>.
Change the <b>Sector Effector lotag</b> to <b>20</b>.  Move the Sector
Effector near the wall you wish to have the bridge extend from.  The bridge
will use the wall closest to the SE-20 as its point of origin.  Change the
<b>angle</b> of the SE-20 to point in the direction you want the bridge to
go.  We want our bridge to extend towards the switch, so the angle is set
to point downwards.
<br>
<br>
The GPSpeed sprite will determine the distance the sprite will move.  When
you first start Build, the default grid size is 256x256 units.  So, to make
the bridge move two grid spaces, you'd set the <b>GPSpeed lotag</b> to 2x256,
or <b>512</b>.  The little green arrows in the image are my additions; they
only show the distance being marked off.

Change to 3d mode and point the cursor at the floor of the peninsula sector.
Hit <b>[R]</b> once to set <b>Relative Alignment</b>, which will make the floor expand as
the sector stretches out.  Please note the ceiling will also expand, so the
tiles will look offset to the rest of the ceiling around it.  By using
Relative Alignment, the tiles will appear to expand from the Sector's Firstwall.
To change the FirstWall assignment, change to 2d mode and move the cursor
<b>inside</b> the sector to be modified.  Move the cursor close to the desired
wall so that it starts to flash.  With the cursor still inside the sector,
hold down the [ALT] key, and hit [F].  You can also do this in 3d mode, by
pointing at the wall inside the sector, then hitting [ALT] +F.  But there's
not always a wall there, ie if another sector shares that wall, and the
ceiling and floor are flush between both sectors.
