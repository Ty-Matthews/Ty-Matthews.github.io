<h1>Two-Way Trains</h1>

Make four sectors, like the image shown.  The two large sectors will be the
track and platform, and the inside sector will be the actual train.

Change the <b>sector lotag</b> of the two inside sectors to <b>31</b>.

<table cellpadding="0">

Place a Sector Effector sprite inside the car sector, and change its
<b>lotag</b> to <b>30</b>.  Change the <b>angle</b> of the SE-30 to point
towards the front of the car.  Change to 3d mode and raise the floor of the
2x1 sector inside the car.  Place a switch flat against the wall of this
raised sector, and change its <b>lotag</b> to a unique switch number, I'll
use 1 in this example.  Insert an Activator sprite within the car sector,
and change its <b>lotag</b> to the same number you gave to the switch
lotag.  The Activator is what triggers the SE-30 when the switch is flipped.

Place two Locator sprites, one on each end of the track, to mark the two
points at which the car will stop.  Change the <b>lotag</b> of one of the
two Locator sprites to <b>1</b>, it then becomes point B.

You can trigger separate events when the car stops at the two Locator
positions.  For instance, you can have a door open when the car stops at
the left-most position.  I'll show an example of having two doors open
up, each opens when the car stops at that given Locator.  To do this, you
need to change the SE-30 <b>hitag</b> to a unique Activator number, I'll
use 5.  We then place an Activator sprite in the two door sectors. 
They will then trigger the Sector Tag (or SE if one was there) within those
sectors.  Here, we want to trigger a door, which is Sector Tag 20.
Change the <b>lotag</b> of the <b>Activator</b> you wish to be triggered
when the car stops at <b>point A</b> to the same number you gave to the
<b>SE-30 hitag</b> (5).  Move over to the other Activator, and change its
<b>lotag</b> to <b>1 + the SE-30 hitag</b> (6).  This will trigger when the
car stops at point B.
