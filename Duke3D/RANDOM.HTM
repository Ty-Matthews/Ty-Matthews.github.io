<td>Start out making two sectors, one larger room and a smaller, inner
island sector.  The inner island sector will become the light.

<table cellpadding="0">
<td>Insert two Sector Effectors, one in each sector.  Change the <b>SE Lotags</b>
to <b>3</b>.  Change the <b>SE Hitags</b> to <b>1</b>, which will be unique
in bigger maps.  Change the <b>Sector Hitag</b> of the light sector to <b>1</b>
as well.

Switch to 3d mode and set the ceiling tile of our inner sector to a Light
tile... tiles 120 through 125 are good for this.  Make sure you don't choose a
tile with the word BUST in it... that tile is used by the game to show the
Light is busted.  The shade of the SE sprites determines the brightness
when the Light is on.  Set all of the walls/ceilings/floors in this sample
to some darker shade by pointing at one in 3d mode and hitting the [-] key
8 to 10 times.  You'll want to copy that shade throughout both sectors,
so that they all match up.  To copy shade values, point at the wall you
want to copy.  Press [TAB] to get that wall's attributes.  Then point
at any other wall, hold down the [SHIFT] key, and hit [ENTER].  This will
copy <b>only</b> the shade value... very handy.  Do the same for every
tile in our sample map... but don't change our SE-3.  For more things you
can try with this effect, <a href="seref.htm#SE3">see the SE Reference Guide</a>.
