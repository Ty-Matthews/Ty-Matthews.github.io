Start out making a <a href="doors.htm">doom-like door</a>.  The SE-8 will
only work with a sector that raises the ceiling.  Make the top room like the
picture, with a wall extending through the middle.  We're going
to use this to create a neat lighting effect.  The light will basically
"originate" from the lower sector.  Before we start splitting the sector,
switch to 3d mode to set your tiles, and darken (7 or 8 clicks) the top
sector's walls, ceiling, and floor... it will save a lot of needless
duplication.  We set the sector's shade to when the door is closed. A quick
way of copying shade values is to point at a darkened tile and hit TAB.
Then point at any other tile, hold down the LEFT SHIFT key, and hit ENTER.
This will copy the shading value only.  Very handy.

Switch back to 2d mode and and split the top sector into light-sources slices,
like the image.  We're going to set the shade of each of the slices slightly
different from the others around them to create a dithering effect.

Insert 9 <b>Sector Effectors</b>, one in each section of the top sector, and
one in the door sector.  Change all of the <b>SE lotags</b> to <b>8</b>, and change
all the <b>SE hitags</b> to <b>1</b> (should be unique for multiple sets.)

<table cellpadding="0">

Switch over to 3d mode and darken the <b>shade</b> of the SE-8 sprites in
the sliced sectors.  By default, a Sector Effector will have a shade value
of 0 when first created.  This will create a fairly bright sector when we
open the door, so our largest section of the top sector and the door sector
can stay at that value.  The three SE-8 in our sliced sectors should be darkened
by two clicks.  Point at the SE at hit '-' two times.  The three after that
should be darkened by four clicks.  The last remaining SE will be at six
clicks. I've put numbers representing the shade value next to the SE sprites
in this image.  You'll also notice my door is not all the way at the floor;
I do this so that any changes I need to make to the different SE and shading
can be accomplished much easier.

If you have a wall within a sector that you don't want to light up when
the door opens, set that wall's <b>hitag</b> to <b>1</b>.  You'll want
to do this for the interior door wall; as no light can really reach it.<br><br>

Run your level and check it out.  Stay inside the room when the door closes
and you'll see the slices darken to one shade and lighten to three separate
shades... very neat.
