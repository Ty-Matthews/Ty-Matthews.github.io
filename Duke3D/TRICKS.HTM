  <td><li>To change the palette of a sprite or a sector, point at the object
  and hit ALT-P in 3D mode.  This is not documented anywhere that I can find.<br>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><li>When loading your own custom images using <a href="editart.htm">EDITART</a>, import your
  graphics using the .GIF format.  They tend to import better.<br>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><li>To find and use the correct Duke3D palette, take a screen shot with
  <a href="editart.htm">EDITART</a> when viewing one of the tiles.  Hit F12 at anytime and a .PCX image
  of that tile will be created named CAPT000x.PCX.  Load this image using a
  paint program such as <a href="http://www.midwest.net/software/cwsapps/image.html#psp">PaintShop Pro</a> and save the palette to
  your Duke directory.  When making new tiles, edit them with your paint
  program using the Duke palette, then saving as a .GIF file.  That way, you
  know exactly what your tile is going to look like.<br>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><li>If you want to load an image using <a href="editart.htm">EDITART</a>, but find the palette
  conversion really messed with the picture, convert the image using a more
  advanced paint program and the correct Duke palette (see above note.)  I've
  found the paint programs do a better job of converting the palette to the
  Duke palette.<br>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><li>Make <b>heavy</b> use of the left-mouse button when editing in
  3D mode.  Click and hold on the sprite/tile you want to alter with the left
  mouse button.  When adjusting floor/ceiling heights or changing their slope,
  this neat feature will keep that tile active for as long as you hold the
  button.<br>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><li>To raise multiple sectors' floors or lower their ceilings at the same
  time, select the group with the right ALT key in 2d mode.  Switch over to
  3d and raise any one of them.  All will raise by the same amount.<br>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><li>To change the shading of any tile or sprite, point at the image in
  3d mode,  hold down ['], and hit [S].  This will let you enter any number,
  which comes in handy for things like cameras which uses the shade for
  angles.  <b>Press [F1] in 3d mode to see an entire list of the ['] commands
  that you can do within Build.</b>  There's lots of neat little shortcuts.
  Also, hit [F1], [F5] and [F6] in 2d mode for other neat displays.<br>
