Start out making two sectors, each 15 units or so on a side.  Then make two
"island" sectors within them, one island in each of the two bigger ones.  As
a reminder, you make an island sector by drawing a sector completely within
a bigger sector, then hitting ALT-S with the mouse pointing inside the smaller
sector.  The inner sector walls will turn red.  The island sectors do not
have to be the same size, even though this picture shows them as being so.

Insert a <b>Sector Effector (SE)</b> <i>within</i> each of the two island
sectors.  Change both of the SE's <b>lotags</b> to <b>7</b>, which is for
transport.  Finally, change both of their <b>hitags</b> to a unique transport number,
just make sure both hitags are equal.  This is how they know which sector
to transport to.  Early on in your build process you should keep track of what
numbers you have used as transporters.  I don't know what would happen if
you set three or more SE-7 hitags to the same number, but I have a feeling it
won't be pretty.
