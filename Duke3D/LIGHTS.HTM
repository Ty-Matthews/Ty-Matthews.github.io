With your sector already in place, switch over to 3d mode and point the cursor
in the approximate location <b>on the wall</b> you wish to place the switch.
Hit S to insert a sprite, then change its tile to the appropriate one.  You
should verify the sprite is placed <i>on</i> the wall by sliding around it
and checking to see if it stays put or follows your viewpoint.  If it stays
put, you've landed it on the wall.  Having it on the wall will avoid those
nasty image clips, which never look good when playing.  Move the sprite to
Duke's level using PgUp/Dn so Duke can get to it.

Insert a <b>SE</b> <i>within</i> the sector you wish to be darkened and
lightened by this switch.  In 2d mode, change the lightswitch sprite's lotag
to a unique lightswitch number, again keep track of what numbers you have
used.  Change the <b>SE lotag</b> to <b>12</b>, which is for Light Switch.
Change the <b>SE hitag</b> to the number you gave to the switch.  This is how
the game knows which switch lights up which room.  Set the <b>shade</b> of the <b>SE</b>
to the brightness you want when the light is flipped on, and set the sector's
shade to the darkness you want when the switch is off.
