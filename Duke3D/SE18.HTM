<h1>Incremental Sector Raise/Fall</h1>

<br><br>

This Sector Effector applies only to the PPak; it is not available with the
1.3 version of Duke3d.

Create three sectors, two room-sized sectors and a dividing door-like sector.
We're going to have the middle door-like sector lower incrementally from the
ceiling so that we can pass through.

<br><br>

Insert an <b>Activator</b> and a <b>Sector Effector</b> in the door-like sector.
Place a switch on the wall nearby.  Change the <b>Sector Effector lotag</b> to
<b>18</b>.  Change the <b>Activator lotag</b> to a unique switch number; I'm
using <b>1</b> here.  Give that same number to the <b>switch lotag</b>.  The
<b>Sector Effector hitag</b> is the rate at which the sector will move.  Setting
this hitag to 1 will cause the sector to lower one unit at a time.  One unit
is defined as one PgUp or PgDn in Build.  Set the <b>Sector Effector hitag</b>
to <b>2</b>.
<br><br>

<br><br>

Switch over to 3d mode and move the SE-18 all the way to the ceiling.  Change
the <b>SE-18 palette</b> to <b>1</b>, by pointing at it and hitting [ALT] +P.
Changing the palette to a number other than 0 will cause the sector to start
at the SE-18 height when playing the game, and then move to where the sector
height is in Build.  Otherwise, the sector would start where it is in Build,
then move incrementally to the SE-18 height when playing the game.

<br><br>
The SE-18 sprite can also move the ceiling.  Simply change the <b>angle</b>
of the SE-18 sprite so that it points downwards.  You might be wondering
exactly what value the SE-18 sprite would be.  In our example, we've only
got one switch, and it takes 10 or so flips to lower the sector floor down.
Seems kinda tiring to the player, doesn't it?  You can use Touchplate
sprites scattered about to do the lowering, setting their hitag to 1 so they
only activate once.  That way, Duke will have to walk across multiple
areas to lower it all the way.
<br><br>
Another example: say you have a room with 4 dipswitches mounted about.
As soon as Duke walks in, a Touchplate sprite closes the door behind him.
One of the dipswitches opens another door to get out.  The other 3 are linked
to a SE-18 and cause the ceiling to lower by 20 notches... but the ceiling is
only 40 notches over the floor.  Two wrong guesses and Duke's toast :)  Play
with it, and see what you can come up with.
