Start out making one large sector with a smaller sector inside it, as an 
island.  For posterity's sake, let's make the inner sector a circle.  Switch
over to 3d mode and raise the inner island sector up a few notches so that
we can differentiate the two.

Place two SectorEffectors within the inner island sector.  Change both
of the <b>SE hitags</b> to a unique rotating sector number above 0.  Change 
the <b>lotag</b> of one of these <b>SE</b> sprites to <b>1</b> and leave the 
other <b>SE lotag</b> at 0.  The SE with the lotag of 1 (SE-1) will be your 
<b>pivot</b> point to which all of the SE-0 sectors (with identical hitags) 
will rotate around.  You can place the SE-1 anywhere you like, it does not
have to be within the sector you're rotating.  In this example, I've put the
pivot point right in the middle of the circle sector.

<br><br>

You can have multiple SE-0 with the same hitag, but you cannot have multiple
SE-1 with the same hitag.  To have the sector rotate clockwise, set the angle
of the SE-1 to upwards.  Set the SE-1 angle down for counter-clockwise.
You will probably want to have any sprites (including Duke) placed on that 
sector rotate with it, so change over to 3d mode and set the floor tile to 
be <b>Relatively aligned</b>.  You do this by pointing the crosshairs at 
the floor of the sector you wish to rotate and hitting 'R'.  You should 
see the tile shift a little bit.  If you don't have the floor Relatively 
aligned, the walls will look like they are rotating, but the floor will 
not.   If Duke stands on the sector, he won't rotate with it.  This might 
come in handy if you wished to set up scrolling tiles, like a message bar.
