<h1>Mirrors</h1>

Start out making three sectors: one large room on the bottom which will be our
room to be mirrored, one middle sector which will hold the mirror, and the
third which will be used by the game to generate the mirrored image.  Make
the third room is <b>bigger</b> than the to-be-mirrored sector, but make sure
it is the same floor/ceiling height as the sector which "holds" the mirror.
For some reason, if the larger room is at different heights, you'll get HOM
when Duke ducks down.  It is <b>crucial</b> that the room be larger than any
space the mirror could possibly see.

Switch to 3d mode and alter the floor/ceiling heights so they resemble the
picture.  Make the floor of the top sector higher than the other two for
right now.  Make the mirror sector wherever you wish; here I've made it a few
notches higher than the main room, and a little bit lower.  I've also changed
the tile of the top sector so that we can discern more easily from the other
walls.<td>

<table cellpadding="0">

Point at the wall (which I've made red here) of the top sector and hit <b>'1'</b>.
This will make it a <b>one-way wall</b>.  You should see a tile fill the gap
between the floor and ceiling of the top sector.  Point at this wall and
change its tile to tile number <b>560</b>, which isn't very easy to spot,
even in 320x200 mode.  It is named mirror, fortunately.

<table cellpadding="0">
<td colspan=2>
While still pointing at the wall, hit both <b>'B'</b> and then <b>'H'</b>.
This will make that wall both <b>blocking</b> and <b>hitscan</b>, which
will prevent us from walking through it, and also make it sensitive to
ammo hits.  If you switch back over to 2d mode, you will see the wall appear
a bright pink.

Move your white pointer into the top sector (which you'll no longer be
able to do in 3d mode with the wall blocked) and switch back over to 3d mode.
Move the floor of the top sector down below the bottom sector, and make sure
the ceiling is higher than the bottom sector as well.
