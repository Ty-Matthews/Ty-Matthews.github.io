        scans along the walls towards the right as long as the tiles are the
        same as the chosen wall.  Some walls may not work right, especially
        floor/ceiling steps.  Sometimes build will lock on machines with

        all values change the color for certain tiles.
</tr>

<tr>
        <td>O
        <td>Wall orientation (whether it starts from the top or bottom.)
        Normally, walls are oriented from the top.  For example, if
        you hold down 2/8 on the keypad in 3d mode, the wall always starts
        from the top.  Orientation works differently for white lines and
        red lines, so if a wall doesn't look right, just press [O] anyways
        to see if it fixes it.  This is especially true of glass walls- press
        [O] once on the tile above the glass wall if it gets screwed up when
        you shoot the glass in the game.
</tr>
<tr>
        <td>TAB
        <td>Copy.  Copies the attributes of the pointed-at sprite/tile into

        x-repeat. y-repeat. and cstat values.

<tr>
        <td>Left ENTER
        <td>Paste.  Paste the stored attributes over the pointed-at
        sprite/tile.  Whenever you press ENTER, the y-repeat values stay the
        same, and the x-repeat values are adjusted so the pixels of the
        bitmaps have a square-aspect ratio.

        as the lightest shade you want.  Then make any other wall of the
        loop as dark as the darkest shade you want.  Finally press Ctrl-Shift-ENTER
        on the wall that should be the lightest.  Now the loop should be smoothly
        shaded.  If it doesn't work, you may need to insert more points on the

        the tile.  Press [E] again, and the tile will be expanded, so the pixel
        size is the same as the normal 64*64 ceiling/floor.

        <td>Relative alignment.  Allows floor/ceiling textures to align to

        pressing B on a wall will take off any hitscan you may have placed
        on it.

        <td>Make a maskable wall.  Point at the tile below or above the
        window to set.  The wall takes all of its attributes from the front
        of the wall, so it must have the same repeat, panning, and cstat
        values as the walls above or below it.  The masking is added to the
        other side as well, with the image flipped.
</tr>
<tr>
        <td>Shift-M
        <td>Same as above, except the wall is one-sided.

</tr>
<tr>
        <td>2
        <td>Some walls have two different sections (like the tiles above
        and below a window.)  Normally they always have the same attributes.
        It is possible though to give both the top and bottom different
        attributes by pressing 2 on that wall.  They then become separately
        editable.

        make the sprite fixate vertically, like a poster.  Pressing R again

        you from walking through.  Also makes the sprite sensitive to hitscan.

        existing line.  You must end the split on another wall of the
        starting point's sector, and you cannot cross any red lines when
        drawing.  
        <dd>3.  Drawing a sector completely inside a sector (like columns.) To
        do this, just press space bar at every point in the loop.  Do not make

        you can drag the point to wherever you want, or draw a sector from that
        point.  If a bunch of points are selected (see right Alt) then instead
