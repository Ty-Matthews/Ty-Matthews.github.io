Great level made by Tyler Day.  Excellent tile selection, great lighting job,
challenging SE puzzles, and solid design.  What more can I say... it's a
blast!

Part two of Ben Roffelson's Aqua series.  This is probably the best user map I've ever
played.  Awesome textures, fantastic lighting, tons of eye-candy, & beautifully
designed.  The only problem with it is there's just too much.  If you
play the hardest level on 486-class machines, it grinds to a halt.  I haven't
played it on a Pentium, but I'd bet it soars.  If ya have a Pentium, get this
level.  Now.

Great Dukematch-only level.  Tons of ambient sounds, excellent textures, nice
layout, and cool doors.  It's just the right size for Dukematch.

Level designed by Matthew Dean & Tony Polichroniadis, modelled after their college living quarters.  It's
strictly DukeMatch, as there are no monsters.  Great new tiles, and very
detailed sector editing.  Check out the toaster and the microwave!

Excellent level by Dave, modelled after his house, I guess, as there is
no .txt file with this level.  Great tile/sprite variety and realism.
Dukematch only.

Huge level made by John "Kasai" Leonard.  Lots of monsters, large sloping
terrains, great variety, and challenging play.  Single player only for now,
but DukeMatch and Co-op are in the works.  Includes hint file if you're
having problems :)

Awesome DukeMatch level made by Byron Collins.  Great tile selection,
excellent use of sectors over sectors, nice multiplayer traps, and excellent
technical Build skills.  It's DukeMatch only, and a total blast.

The second version of Byron's Outpost map, adding tons of neat features,
including single-player support.  A great sequel to his popular first edition.

Huge level with all four difficulty settings.  Supports DukeMatch & Co-op,
although it was designed for solo.  Nine secrets, 74 monsters, and a large
layout.  Try it out and let me know what you think!
