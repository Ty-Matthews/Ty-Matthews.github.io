Start out making one sector with an island inside it.  Make the larger sector
15 to a side and the smaller island around 10x5 units.  The larger sector
will be your room, and the island sector will appear as water.  Off to the
side, and separate from the other two, make another sector that is <b><i>
exactly</i></b> the same size as the island sector; 10x5 or whatever you
made.

<td>
Place a SE in both the island sector and the separate sector.  Change the
<b>SE hitags</b> on both to a unique Water Sector tag, again keep track of which
numbers you've used.  Set the <b>SE lotags</b> to <b>7</b>, which as you might
already know, is for transport. That's basically what water sectors are;
you transport to another sector that is underwater.  The differences being
there isn't the transport sound and flash, and you transport by either
falling through the floor or by swimming past the ceiling.  The two SE-7
<b>must</b> be in the same location on both sectors or you'll have nasty
deaths.  Set the <b>sector lotag</b> of the "above water" sector to <b>1</b>.
Set the <b>sector lotag</b> of the "below water" sector to <b>2</b>.  Change
over to 3d mode while putting the white arrow in the "above water" sector and
change the floor tile to the water texture.  Do the same for the "below
water" sector ceiling.
