Start out making four sectors, two large ones of varying size, and two smaller
ones (each attached to one of the bigger ones) which will become the actual
elevator.  Each smaller sector must be <b><i>exactly</i></b> the same size.

Insert an <b>SE</b> within each of smaller sectors and change the <b>SE lotags</b>
to <b>17</b>, which is for an elevator.  Assign a unique elevator number and put that
in both of the <b>SE hitags</b>.  Change both of the smaller <b>sector lotags</b> 
to <b>15</b>.  Pick one of the two to be the higher floor, and change that <b>sector
hitag</b> to 1.  Leave the other at 0.  It's a good idea to put the SE sprites
on the same coordinates of both sectors; that way Duke won't shift when he
goes up and down it.

That's it for tags and such, now you must go into 3d mode and change the <b>shades</b>
of the SEs, as well as the floor/ceiling heights of the two elevator sectors.  The <b>ceiling
height</b> of the lower floor <b>must be</b> lower than <b>floor height</b> of the
upper floor, or it won't work.  You'll get in the elevator and either rise or
fall for an eternity.  Put the white arrow in the lower sector and switch over
to 3d mode.  The <b>darker shaded</b> SE-17 is the floor where the elevator
will start.  I found this shade <i>must be at least 32 shades dark</i>.  To darken
the SE, point at it in 3d mode, hold down the ['] key and hit [S].  Enter the
number 32 and hit [ENTER].
