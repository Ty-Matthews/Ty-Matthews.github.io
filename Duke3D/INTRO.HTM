<dd>Hello, and welcome to my Duke3D level-editor FAQ page.  When I first
installed the shareware version of Duke and played the eight levels,  I was
astonished at the level of detail put into each level and the truly
revolutionary things that were being done to the 3D first-person gaming
genre.  To my great pleasure, I read in gaming magazines and the closing
screen shots of Duke about the free level editor they were going to be shipping
with the registered version and the commercial CD. <br>
<dd>Within days of its release, I ran out and purchased the game and
immediately began playing with the editor;  here on out referred to as Build.
Unlike most other editors I've used with games such as Doom, this was a
complete breakthrough in ease of use.  Setting textures, sprites, &
ceiling/floor heights was so easy I had to pinch myself to make sure I
wasn't dreaming.  Many kudos to the programming prowess of Ken Silverman,
the brain behind the 3D engine used in Duke and the creator of this Build
program.<br><br>
<dd>Life isn't always perfect, I've found, and my early euphoria turned into
frustration as I meddled with the editor and help files included with it.  I
couldn't manage to figure anything out those first few days, and the help
files were much less than that.  The program BuildHLP, which is included with
the whole Build tools set, is good for laying out the basic details of
level design; making sectors, splitting them, joining them, inserting
sprites, and the like.  What they failed to include was how to create the
more advanced features; sliding doors, rotating sectors, subways, etc.  They
listed out the different Sector Effectors and what they did, but nothing as
far as how to implement them, or how the sectors should be laid out.<br><br>

<dd>I'm assuming in all of my tutorial pages that you've read the BuildHLP
files and know how to make sectors, set ceiling/floor heights, insert sprites,
change sprite tiles to Sector Effectors, and the common Build tasks.  In
certain places, I've pointed out how to accomplish a certain task in case
it wasn't mentioned in the help files, or if the help files were simply
wrong.  The most frustrating error I came across early was how to make
a sector within another sector.  The help files say to hit ALT-Insert
on the inner sector.  This key combination duplicates sprites, unrelated
to sectors.  The real combination is ALT-S.<br><br>
                                                                       
<dd>I decided early on in my quest to solve these puzzles that <b>no one</b> should
have to struggle through making interesting and challenging levels for this
awesome game.  I spent many nights taking apart other levels to see how
they, the level lords at <a href="http://www.3drealms.com">3DRealms</a>, made
their trick levels.  Even then, the levels were so intricately laid out it
was hard to discern the multitude of sprites overflowing my screen.  And
then I found the perfect maps.  In the Build directory of your CD, there
are two maps included with the editor.  They are _SE.MAP and _ST.MAP.  These
two maps include <b>every</b> possible thing you can do with sectors.  I
tore them apart like a dog with a rag doll.  Now everything seemed to fall
into place.<br><br>

<dd>There are many little tricks you need to know in order to make your
levels appear seamless, and natural.  What looks like a single line on
a sample map may in fact be two, three, or even more lines layered on top
of each other.  The Build program is half 2D and half 3D.  The 2D half can
get quite confusing when sectors are layered over sectors (a very crucial
effect when planning multi-floored levels.)  Unfortunately, we can't spend
all of our time in 3d mode.<br><br>

<dd>Before you begin your very rewarding and challenging quest to make the
ultimate levels, please heed some advice.  <b>Save your work often</b>.  On
my 486 at home, the Build program <b>frequently</b> dumps me entirely from
the editor when switching between 2D and 3D mode, taking with it the changes
to my level I just spent twenty minutes on.  I've gotten so used to it now
that I simply save my work <b>before</b> I even switch over to 3D mode.  If
you have a relatively slower box, like a 486, I recommend highly that you
save your work frequently.  Make numerous backups of your level, ie naming
copies like "mylevel1.map", "mylevel2.map" so that you have some history as
your level progresses.  If something goes terribly wrong, you have the last
stage still on hand to revert to.<br><br>

page layouts, and neat little tricks:  <a href="mailto:taltos@super-highway.net">Don Rogers</a>, &

<dd>The following people have contributed to the tutorial pages, making it
the best we possibly can:  <a href="mailto:adam_ashley@geocities.com">Adam Ashley</a>
and <a href="mailto:jfgrol@cam.org">Jean-Francois Groleau</a>.  Write and
thank them sometime, they've done excellent work :)<br><br>

<dd>If you've come across a neat effect, find an error in my page(s), have
a suggestion for the layout, wrote a description on how to do something not listed
here, or any undocumented information at all to do with the Build level editor,
please send me a note, at <a href="mailto:ty@synet.net">ty@synet.net</a>. I'll
include your name here under acknowledgements and on any page I've created
discussing your findings.  I've still got some topics untouched right at the
moment; I simply haven't had enough time to write out the tutorial.  I look
forward to hearing from people as they come across neat tricks and little
caveats, so that we can share with the rest of the level makers out there.
If you've found these pages useful, or informative, I'd love to hear about
that too.<br>

<dd>Good luck, and happy level-editing :)<br>
