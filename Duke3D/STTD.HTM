<h1>Star Trek Doors - Normal and Split</h1>

<table cellpadding="0">
<td>Start out making five sectors, like the image here.  The top and
bottom sectors are the two rooms being joined.  Set the <b>Sector Lotag</b>
of the very middle sector to <b>9</b> for Normal Star Trek Door, or <b>26</b>
for Split Star Trek Door.  From here on out, I will refer to this as our
"tagged" sector.  This will become the door.  The two sectors surrounding the
tagged sector are entryways, so that the door has equal floor/ceiling heights
on both sides to use as markers.

<table cellpadding="0">
<td>Take grid-locking off and insert six vertices; three per white line of our
tagged sector.  The four points, marked by the little green arrows, must be
kept in line with the door's red lines.  We'll do this in the next step.

<table cellpadding="0">
<td>We need to move the white line vertices we just inserted so they represent
the shape of a door, one door on each side.  Two catches when making Star Trek
Doors:  1) the white lines of the door must be right on top of the red
lines of its parent sector, and 2) you must have both halves of the door touching
in the middle.   What will happen in the game is this:  the door will split
open from the middle, the ceiling will raise to a neighbor, the floor will
lower to that neighbor, and any void-player space (our door) will move
to the sides.  Hit 'G' in 2d mode to increment the grid spacing by one.  We
need to be perfectly inline with the red lines, and our two doors must meet
in the middle.  Move the vertices so they come close to the image.

Take it one step further and move the two points of the door halves so they
share the same spot.  They won't join into one... they will simply occupy
the same place in Build.  Insert a <b>MusicAndSFX</b> sprite in now before we
get any further.  This sprite must be located in the player space area.
Set the MusicAndSFX <b>lotag</b> to <b>166</b>, or any music number you
prefer.  The lotag represents both opening and closing sounds.

<table cellpadding="0">
<td>Now is a good time to set the door's tiles.  Switch over to 3d mode
and set your tiles.  Please note the tiles of our door will squish when the
door opens.  Our door is pretty small and will open very fast, so the player
shouldn't notice anything unusual about the tile squishing.

<td>If you only wanted to make a Normal Star Trek Door, you could stop here.
If you want to make a Split Star Trek Door, we still have another door left
to handle... the door that splits from the middle and opens vertically.
Luckily, there are no more sectors to add.  The sector already exists...
it is our tagged sector.  Switch to 3d mode and point at the sector floor of
our tagged sector.  Raise the tagged sector's floor so it reaches the
middle-height of the surrounding rooms.  Change the floor tile to an
appropriate door tile, and do the same for the tagged sector's ceiling.
Now point at the tagged sector's ceiling and lower it as far as it can go;
right down to the "floor", which is now in the middle of the room.  Set
the door's tiles, and you're pretty much finished.  You'll probably want to
have separately editable tiles for both the top half and bottom half of
your door.  Remember that to make them separately editable, you hit the
number [2] when pointing at the wall.
