Create one decent-sized room, with a hall extending out of it.  Switch to
3d mode and pick a tile for the walls that has a horizontal stripe.  Adjust
the tile position (using the arrow keys) so that some easily-identifiable
line is at the ceiling.  Here, I'm using the light as a guide.  Slope the
floor and ceiling of the hall upwards so that the far end of it is
higher than the tile mark.  This ensures any sectors we create at the end
of the hall will be higher than our first sector.

There are some limitations to Sectors Over Sectors, so let me cover them
now:
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td width=50 align=right valign=top>
  1.
  </td>
  <td>
  Build cannot "see" two overlapping sectors at the same time.
</tr>

<tr>
  <td width=50 align=right valign=top>
  2.
  </td>
  <td>
  Overlapping sectors cannot share red lines.
</tr>

<tr>
  <td width=50 align=right valign=top>
  3.
  </td>
  <td>
  Overlapping sectors must be built at separate physical heights.
  </td>
</tr>

<table cellpadding="0">

   Add three more sectors, like the image shown.  But pause after you create
   the first sector coming off the sloped hall.  Sometimes Build will go in
   and mess up your floors/ceilings when adding sectors to a sloped sector.
   Mainly, it's going to set sloping for the new sector.  If this happens,
   you'll want to correct the situation before adding too many sectors.  To
   take all sloping off of a sector, point at the floor and/or ceiling and
   hit [/].  You'll notice in this image that I've inserted extra vertices
   in the last sector.  We're going to use these vertices to extend that
   sector over the lower sector.

Move the vertices of the last sector over the lower sector.  I've numbered
the vertices in the first image, and shown their corresponding results in
the second image.

Switch to 3d mode, and "walk" between the upper and lower
floors.  Kinda neat, huh?  You may ask what that fourth sector was for.
We created that sector so that there is no single spot where Duke is able
to see two overlapping sectors at the same time.  Also, it is not a requirement
that you drag vertices over an existing sector to create the effect.  You can
create new sectors over existing ones, so long as you've started from a
point that is known to be at the level you want.  If you just start creating
a sector in an area shared by two or more overlapping sectors, it will default
to the lowest physical sector.
<br><br>
Some sage advice on Sectors Over Sectors:

<table cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td width=50 align=right valign=top>
</td>
<td>
<b>Never</b> attempt to join sectors in areas that are overlapping.  This
can cause many, many problems... especially if you're trying to join sectors
that are higher than the lowest overlapped sector.
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>
<b>Always</b> create your sectors/sprites off to a side, and don't overlap
sectors until you're ready to finish the map.  Create a long hallway if you
need to give yourself room.  Joining, splitting, and moving sectors that
overlap is a real nightmare.  Just create them off to a side, and move
the entire lot over when its ready.
</td>
</tr>
<td></td>
<td>
Don't insert/move sprites in 2d mode in an area of overlapped sectors.  They
default to the lowest sector, and probably not the sector you're trying to
use.
</td>
</tr>
<td></td>
<td>
If you've moved your finished sector over a bunch of other sectors, and need
to go back and change something, remember there are keys in 3d mode to change
hitags and lotags.  They are [']-[H] and [']-[T] for hi/lo, respectively.
