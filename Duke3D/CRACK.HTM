Make one sector about 10x7 in size.  Insert two vertices on the top
line and draw another sector right above our first sector.  Insert another
two vertices, this time in the middle of the top two lines (we're going to
split the top sector.)   Split the top sector by drawing a line between
the two points you just inserted.  Your map should look like this picture.
It's crucial that you split the top sector and not try to make each half
separately.  I've found doing the latter causes weird problems.

Insert two Sector Effectors, one in each half of the top sector.  Change
the <b>SE lotags</b> to <b>13</b>.  Change the two <b>SE hitags</b> to
<b>1</b>, or any unused SE-13 number.  Insert four sprites, two in each
sector, and change the sprite tile to <b>SEENINE</b> (get it? C-9? :).
The SEENINE sprite is tile number 1247.  Change all four <b>SEENINE
hitags</b> to <b>1</b>, or the number you assigned to the SE-13.  The
<b>SEENINE lotag</b> is set to the amount of time delay you want the
explosions to occur after you've hit the crack with an explosion of its own.
Here, I've spread the time delay around, making values 20, 40, 60, and 80
so that the explosion will appear to travel across the two sectors.

Switch over to 3d mode and insert a sprite <b>on the wall</b> above the
two sectors.  I've also set tiles and floor/ceiling heights/slopes to
something that resembles a gaping hole in a wall after an explosion.  Set
the sprite's tile to tile number 546 (crack).  Move the crack down (pgup/pgdn
on the sprite) so that it floats in mid-air, positioned in the middle of the
hole.  The crack can be anywhere at all in the game, but we want it to be
fairly close to where the explosion will occur.  When the game is run, this
crack will appear against a solid wall.  The solid wall is created by the
SE-13, which tells the game to put both ceiling and floor at the same
height at the start of the level.  Switch back over to 2d mode and set
the <b>crack's hitag</b> to <b>1</b>, or the number you have been
assigning to the SE-13 hitag.

<br><br>

When an explosion hits this crack, the sectors will move to the positions
they had in Build, and the C-9 explosives will burst in sequence.  You can
make only the ceiling or floor match the height of the SE sprite by changing
the angle of the SE-13 to pointing down.  By default the angle points up,
which makes the game put both ceiling and floor at the same height/slope,
so that our hole will not exist.<br><br>

<table cellpadding="0">
<td>
The hole does not have to be caused only by a crack. To have another
"exploding" sprite (ie other C-9s or the Fire Extinguisher Sprite) cause
the hole to explode, set the sprite's <b>hitag</b> to the same number you
gave the SE-13 hitag.

You can have the hole explode when Duke walks across the floor, as well.
Insert a <b>TOUCHPLATE</b> sprite in any sector which Duke will walk across.
Set the TOUCHPLATE's <b>lotag</b> to the same number you gave the SE-13
hitag.
