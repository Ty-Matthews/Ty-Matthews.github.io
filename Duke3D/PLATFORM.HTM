<td>Elevator Platforms are probably the easiest of all sector effects.  All
they require is a simple Sector Tag to work.  I'm going to cover all
four of the different platforms on this page.  Make your lower floor
and upper floor like the picture, with four elevators.

<table cellpadding="0">
<td>Switch to 3d mode and set the floor/ceiling heights like so.  The
left-most elevator will drop down from its current height when activated,
floor only.  The second elevator will rise from its current height,
floor only.  The third elevator will drop from its current height, both
ceiling and floor.  Finally the fourth elevator will rise from its current
height, both ceiling and floor.

Set the first <b>sector lotag</b> to 16, the second to 17, the third to 18
and the last to 19.  Insert four MusicAndSFX sprites, one per platform, and
change all of their <b>hitags</b> to 73, and all of their <b>lotags</b> to
71.  That's all there is to it.<tr>
