Start up BUILD and make two separate sectors, one sector (10 units per side
for now) and the other right above it, its bottom wall running parallel to the
top wall of the lower sector.  Insert two vertices 6 or 7 grid spaces apart on
each of the walls of the two sectors.  Make another sector (basically joining
your two sectors) using the four vertices you just inserted.  Your design
should be close to the picture shown.

While in 2d mode, point the mouse pointer inside the new "door" sector (the
one sandwiched between the two bigger sectors) and insert a sprite.  Move
the pointer over a little ways and insert another sprite.  It is critical
that these sprites be inside that sector.  Switch over to 3d mode and change
one of the sprites to a <b>Sector Effector (SE)</b>, and the other to a <b>MusicAndSndFX</b>.
Switch back to 2d mode and set the tags for the <b>SE</b> to <b>64 hitag</b>, and
<b>10 lotag</b>.  The hitag is used for the length of time the door will stay
open.  64 is about 2 seconds.  The lotag is for Door Auto Close.  Change the
<b>MusicAndSndFX</b> sprite's lotag to 166, which is the Doom-like sound of
a door opening.  Set the <b>door sector's</b> lotag to <b>20</b>, which is
for a ceiling door.  Finally, when all that is complete, switch back again to
3d mode and lower the door's ceiling all the way to its floor.  Just make
sure you've picked the tiles you like first :)

To make the door come down from the ceiling, simply change the <b>sector lotag</b>
from 20 to 21, and move the <b>door sector's</b> floor and ceiling to the
surrounding sector's ceiling.<br><br>
To make the door split from the middle, simply change the <b>sector lotag</b>
from 20 to 22, and move the <b>door sector's</b> floor and ceiling to
the middle of the door.
