Start out by making 6 sectors like the picture shown.  Set the <b>Sector Tag</b>
of the two smaller sectors to <b>25</b>.  For the rest of this page, I'm going
to refer to these two sectors as the <b>"Tagged Sectors"</b>.  Do not change any of the
floor heights of these sectors you've created, they should all be the same.  What
basically is going to happen is the game will shift any non-player space
(marked by the white lines) in each sector to either the left or the right
depending on how we've set it up.  Therefore, the ceiling and floor should be
at where you want it to look when the door is <b>open</b>.  The two sectors
directly to the top and bottom of our tagged sectors are going to be used
in a step later on; they are important to place.

Insert two <b>SE sprites</b>, one in each of the tagged sectors.  Change their
<b>hitags</b> to a number not used elsewhere by any sliding door.  We want to
make them the same hitag so both doors will open at the same time.  Change the
<b>SE lotag</b> to <b>15</b>.  Insert a <b>GPSPEED</b> sprite within each of
these two sectors.  Change the <b>GPS lotag</b> to <b>512</b>.  The GPS lotag is
the distance the doors will open.  This will probably take a lot of adjusting
as you test your level.  The last thing to insert is a MusicAndSndFx sprite.
You only need to insert one, as both doors will open simultaneously.   Just
make sure the MSFX is within one of those two sectors.  Change the <b>MSFX
lotag</b> to 170, which is a long, dragging sound.

Change the angle of the left-most SE-15 to point right.  Change the angle of
the right-most SE-15 to point left.  They should point in the direction the
door will close to.  Take grid-locking off and move all of our Sector-Effectors,
GPSPEEDs, and MSFX sprites as close to the dividing line as possible.  It
also helps to take off showing of tags by hitting [CTRL] - [T].

The next few steps are a little difficult to explain, so I'm going to show
them in little increments.  With grid-locking off, insert three vertices on
the two white lines of our tagged sectors.

Turn grid-locking back on, and move the top points (which are now our "doors")
onto the tagged sectors' lines, making sure not to leave the sprites outside of
player space.  Move the two middle points to the very center spot.  They will
occupy the same space, but will not be deleted.

Move the adjacent top sectors' vertice to the tagged sector's top line.

Move it right on top of the tagged sector's top line.

Do the same for the other three.  They should all be on the tagged sectors'
lines.<td>

These last few steps were necessary to avoid texture warping; that nasty
little effect when sectors are getting pushed around.  The warping is
still there, the player just can't see it :)
